The CreditCard Validator project is a C++ application designed to validate Mastercard information, categorize cards based on various criteria, and organize them into valid and invalid lists. 

Feel free to get started with CreditCardValidator, the driver file. All classes and methods are called and executed in this file, so it is an excellent way to see how the project was implemented.
